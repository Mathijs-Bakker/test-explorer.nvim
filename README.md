# [wip] :compass: Test Explorer

## Disclaimer
These are my first baby steps in creating a NeoVim plugin with Lua.
I am quite a n00b with Lua and lacking best practices concerning NeoVim plugins.
So bear with me ;)

## :compass: Installation
With vim-plug:
```
  Plug 'Mathijs-Bakker/the-dottest-chili.nvim'
```
