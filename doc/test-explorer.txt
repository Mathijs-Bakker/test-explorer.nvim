COMMANDS                                                 testexplorer-commands

|:RunTests|                                                        *:RunTests*

==============================================================================
OPTIONS				                                      testexplorer-options

|show_results_leftside|                     testexplorer_show_results_leftside

                Opens the test window to the left. 
                When this is not set, the default behavior opens the
                test window ro the right side.

                g:testexplorer_show_results_leftside = 1

|filename_match_tests|                       testexplorer_filename_match_tests

                Filters only files that matches 'Test' in the filename.
                When set to 1, only files that match 'Tests' in their name will 
                be included for hashing tests. Case sensitive.

                Eg:
                - MyTestClassNameTests.cs gets hashed
                - Tests_SomeName.cs gets also hashed
                - MyTestClassName.cs is not getting hashed

                It could squeeze out some extra performance with large test 
                suites. Or force a good habit to add 'Tests' in the filenames. 
                
                Default:
                g:testexplorer_filename_match_tests = 0
